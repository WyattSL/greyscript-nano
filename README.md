# greyscript-nano
**greyscript-nano** is a extension to the [nano text editor](https://nano-editor.org).

To install greyscript-nano, download the `greyscript.nanorc` file, and then edit your `.nanorc` configuration to include the file.

For example, I would edit `/etc/nanorc`, and at the bottom, append `Include /home/wyatt/greyscript-nano/greyscript.nanorc`.
